When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  It is a secure place seoerate from a single computer to store work. It also makes the work available 
  to other to edit and commit changes to the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You want control over what is being pulled and at what time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are a copy of an existing repository on Github and a new copy is made in my own respository space. A branch is created on my local computer. A clone is a copy of a reposistory that lives wither on Github or on my local machine.
